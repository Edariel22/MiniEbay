[Fix: AddUser.jsp insertion not working]

Problem:
The JSP showed "Cannot be added" even though the SQL syntax looked correct.
No data was being inserted into the 'users' table.

Cause:
The MySQLCompleteConnector.doInsert() method used 'stmt.execute()' and stored its return value in 'res'.
However, 'stmt.execute()' returns 'false' for INSERT statements (since they don't produce a ResultSet),
so 'res' was never set to true even when the insert actually ran.

Fix:
Changed:
    res = stmt.execute(charString);
to:
    stmt.execute(charString);
    res = true;

Explanation:
This ensures the statement executes first, and then 'res' is manually set to true.
This matches the logic used in class while fixing the incorrect boolean return behavior.
